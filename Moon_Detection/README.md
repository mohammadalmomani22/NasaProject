## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing seismic data and potentially detecting key events within it. The project is built using Python and leverages various data processing techniques such as downsampling, filtering, and peak detection.

## Installation

### Required Libraries:
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `scipy`
- `obspy` (for reading seismic data)

To install the required libraries, run the following:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scipy obspy
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/moon-detection.git
    cd moon-detection
    ```

2. Run the Python notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook Moon_Detection.ipynb
    ```

## Results

After running the notebook, you'll see the filtered seismic signal with detected peaks highlighted, enabling further insights into the seismic activity.
